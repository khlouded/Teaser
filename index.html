        HOW THIS WORKS (Delete after completing)
        NAVIGATION
        The navigation is not hidden, it's just pushed all the way to the right and is revealed at a certain pixel amount. for desktop the width is set to 450px, which is the same as the position it is moved to the right. This accounts for preloading and transitions. 

        As you click on the arrow div, this will add the class .visible-grid to the module, making it appear in the right spot

        for responsiveness, I want you to change the width to 100% in the mobile version of the module and to take away the border line. This

        PATTERNS
        Each section is either the ending or different pattern

        RESPONSIVENESS
        Everything is fine up until 480px, where it starts to degrade.

        This should be responsive on every device so instead of taking a bunch of breakpoints online,set your own depending on the content. Check each browser width and see if it all works at any size. Also the height of each pattern should change to do this change SECTION

        There is a problem with the margins on pattern 1
        Set a breakpoint for desktop (which is larger than everything) and reiterate the changes you made on the other breakpoints

        

        For the Logic, there isn't much that we need to change so you don't really need to mess with the JS

        The pattern text size is defined by View Width. If this doesn't work for you in the mobile section you can always change it
